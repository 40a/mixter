Welcome

1 test failed... It's normal :)
It's your first exercice. You should implement the failing test.
When it's green, then call "next" command to jump to next test

If you cannot find the solution, DON'T PANIC. You can go to the next step with the "jumpToNextStep" command. But only use it if you are short on time.

Feel free to use issues in this repo to give your feedback, to propose some improvements, to ask for other languages...and even better to submit pull requests.

Enjoy
