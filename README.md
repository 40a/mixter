Mixter 
======
Mixter is a project to discover CQRS/Event sourcing through koans in multiple
languages. 

At this point the koans have been ported to 4 languages: C#, Java 8, PHP and
Javascript. 

Starting
-------

1. Choose an language and checkout `{language}-workshop`, for `java` that would be
`java-workshop`.
2. Implement the failing test
3. merge and implement the next test : `{language}-test-{step}.{test number}` [1]

[1] to see the list of available tags you can use `git tag -l | grep {language}`

If you somehow get lost or stuck, you can `git merge {language}-solution-{step}` 
or `git checkout {language}-solution-{step}` and see what our solution looks like.
